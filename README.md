# Game Price Tracker

It is a chrome extension which helps to track game prices with auto push notifications to avoid hassle to manually check game prices everyday!
Using this extension, gamers could add their favourite games to the list and the extension would automatically notify the user if their is a price drop available. Currently the extension is in beta phase and contributions are welcomed.

## The process:

1) So I have used React to develop this extension with Manifest.json file which is necessary to create extensions for chrome.
2) I have used background.js file to allow fetching game prices and deals in the background and also to notify the user about price drop periodically.
3) For the API to fetch game details, I used CheapShark API which is helping the extension in fetching game details and tracking the deals available at the moment.

This project helped me learn more about how extensions work and how can one develop it using React. It also polished my skills of fetching APIs. This project allowed me to develop my theoretical skills into some real world practical knowledge/
